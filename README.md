## Abstract

The need for effective unlearning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly urgent, driven by the necessity to adhere to data regulations and foster ethical generative AI practices. LLM unlearning is designed to reduce the impact of undesirable data influences and associated model capabilities without diminishing the utility of the model if unrelated to the information being forgotten. Despite growing interest, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning (TOFU benchmark), malicious use prevention (WMDP benchmark), and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in contrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight attribution techniques.

```
## Running the experiments

First, you need to download the mask files from Google Drive and place them into ```./mask/``` directory. You can download the mask files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BuoYofYB_rq4Oa_t1ojtOsMJyB6nO3ND?usp=sharing). Those mask files name should be like ```{task_name}_{ratio}.pt```. For example, ```tofu_0.8.pt``` represents the mask file for TOFU task with 80% weights are selected for unlearning from WAGLE method.

After downloading the mask files, you can run the following command to run the experiments:
```
python src/exec/unlearn_model.py --config_file configs/{unlearn_task}/{unlearn_method}.json --unlearn.mask_path mask/{unlearn_task}_{ratio}.pt {other_args}
```
